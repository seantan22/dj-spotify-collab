# Beat Switch

Beat Switch is a web application created to help DJs build consistent tracklists. 

*Created using Spotfify Web API, Node.js, Express and React.*

## Motivation

When mixing music, a talented DJ will creatively fuse together song after song by executing technical transitions. These transitions take into account a variety of track characteristics, the most important being tempo. A general rule when choosing the next track is to stay within Â±5 beats per minute of the previous track. This allows a DJ to smoothly blend two songs together in a way that remains undetected by the crowd. 

From my personal experience mixing music, the process of looking for a new track based on tempo can be quite frustrating. Almost all the major music streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Soundcloud do not display the tempo of a song. With Beat Switch, DJs are able to find new songs based on tempo and genre.
